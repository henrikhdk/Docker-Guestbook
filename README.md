## Project Overview â€“ Guestbook Application

The **Guestbook** is a simple web application that we will build and deploy using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.  

The application includes:  
- **Web Frontend**: A user interface with a text input field for entering and submitting messages.  
- **Kubernetes Deployments and Pods**: Each component will be containerized and managed through Kubernetes.  

**Key steps in the project:**  
1. Deploy the Guestbook frontend and backend using Kubernetes Deployments and Pods.  
2. Implement **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** to ensure the application can handle increased traffic.  
3. Perform **Rolling Updates** to release new versions without downtime.  
4. Apply **Rollbacks** when needed to restore a previous stable version.  

This project will demonstrate a complete workflow for containerized application deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management in Kubernetes.
